                    This website was created to be an example of what exactly could make a website bad for the user and unpleasent to use. So just looking at it shows a number of issues that can be easily seen even at just a glance.
                   </p>
                    <br>                  
                   <ul>
                    <li>Constrast: This website seems to have many points of contrast where it can be hard to read the text due to the poor contrast.</li>
                    <li>Repitition: This website is incredibly inconsistent with its style where almost every section is different.</li>
                    <li>Alignment:The alignment is all over the place for this website where it actively tries to make it harder to read.</li>
                    <li>Proximity: There doesnt appear to be any relation between the content besides the idea that all content is all over the place.</li>
                   </ul>

                        This website was desinged with the purpose od selling a product. Just looking at the website briefly it is instantly recognizable and clearly conveys its purpose.But it also at a glance appears to have a clean and easily readable design.This makes the website very easy to work with and read and not to harsh on the eyes when it is viewed.
                    </p>
